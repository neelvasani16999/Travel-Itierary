6,I is one of the most popular tourist destination. It is a historical monument build by Mughal Emperor and is a very masterpiece of excellent architecture. The entry ticket to the monument is very nominal. Food Kiosks outside the monument offer yummy food at very reasonable
7,If you come Delhi  and didn't visit  qutub minar that it's  waste of visit  There is very  greener  and old minar I teach  my son something historically 
8,In our trip to New Delhi this was my favourite spot. The architecture is gorgeous and it is a photographers dream. I would recommend that anyone staying in Delhi get out and see this site.   It is worth paying a guide to get some of the history of the site as there are lots of

30,"Ahhh the memories, went there after 17 years. Great to see that it's being maintained so well. Loeved being back there after so long. Although now, it really is a task to get inside owning to so many people visiting place but it is well worth it once you're inside. Beautiful."
31,we arrived mid afternoon and there was so much to see that we were still there at sunset.Our guide also knew the exact spot to stand to get the very best photos. highly recommend visiting this wonder.
32,Went to see it again after nearly 20 years. What a change. It is really worth seeing it. Impressing ruins in a well kept place.
33,Its a part of Qutub Complex. Minar was built as Victory Tower for Mohammad Ghori over Prithviraj Chauhan and marks start of Muslim rule over India in 1192. Complex was built on a temple site. Iron pillar is one of the major attraction in complex.

38,"Though it is no longer possible to climb the tower, many points of interest can be found in this complex. For instance, guides can show you where idols from 27 Hindu and Jain temples here have been turned upside down and used in building the walls of the Muslim invaders."
39,Worth a visit when in Delhi and exploring the heritage structure in the city. Indian nationals and foreigners have different queues for purchasing tickets at the entrance. Remember to retain the token given as it needs to be returned back on exit. The experience inside is quite

60,I went to see qutub minar along with other monuments in delhi during our travel plans. We went during a weekday and it was less crowded. Easy and quick public transport is available near the qutub minar. Better to go during morning or evening and avoid the sun and crowd. Nice
